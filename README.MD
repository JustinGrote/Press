# Press

Press is a rewrite of PowerCD with some modern decisions:
1. PS7+ Only for Building (built modules can still have lower compatability)
1. Drop Azure Pipelines/Appveyor support and go all-in on Github Actions. Local packages.
1. Support a Github development workflow via Github Pull Requests/Features and vscode
1. Embrace devmoji but still support conventional commits
1. Expand to github releases, changelog support, artifacts, etc.

See the project section for the roadmap
