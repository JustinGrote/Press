## [0.3.0-justingroteiss0031] - 2021-06-08
### New Features
- ✨ Pester Test Tasks Now Isolated to Jobs (#18)
    Enables Pester Tests to be run in an isolated job, useful for avoiding local context dependencies like profiles, and allows for repeated testing of custom c# assemblies and powershell classes without having to restart the main powershell process.
- ✨ Add -Full option for Build-ReleaseNotes
    This parameter generates the entire changelog for the whole project, not just since the last release tag (0ad7852)
- ✨ Restore-NugetPackages
    Allows you to specify a set of nuget packages via hashtable and have the DLLs copied to the module (24c0da9)
- ✨ PowerConfig Configuration Engine (#14)
    Press can now be configured by using environment variables and a .config/Press.yml file. See the "Configuring Press" section in the readme for more detail.
- ✨ Add commits and author credit to Release Notes (#15)
    Release notes now will include direct commit links to directly committed changes
    "Thanks" credits will be added for the primary author of a pull request if it is not the same person who committed the PR.
